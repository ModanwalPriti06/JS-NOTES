# JavaScript-Notes
Basic Javascript notes for beginners


## How to Start
1. Create new repo and add README file.
2. click on code button code > codespace > click
3. take sometime then click file > view > command Plette.
4. search container then click > first Add Dev Container and configuration.
5. crete new configuration click
6. then again search nodejs for javascript and click on and do all few step.
7. Rebuild and m/n will start again wait few min.

## String Interpolation: 
The ability to substitute part of the string for the values of variables or expressions. This feature is also called string interpolation.
## HTML escaping:
The ability to transform a string so that it is safe to include in HTML.
## JavaScript Computed Property
ES6 allows you to use an expression in brackets []. It’ll then use the result of the expression as the property name of an object. For example:
```
let propName = 'c';
const rank = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  [propName]: 3,
};
console.log(rank.c); // 3
```
### When You Should Not Use Arrow Functions
An arrow function doesn’t have its own this value and the arguments object. Therefore, you should not use it as an event handler, a method of an object literal, a prototype method, or when you have a function that uses the arguments object.

### for.. of VS for.. in Loop
```
// Array Iteration

const arr = [4,5,6,7,8];

for(let i of arr){
  console.log("of loop",i)
}
for(let i in arr){
  console.log("in loop",arr[i])
}

// Object Iteration

const person = {
  name: 'john doe',
  age: 24,
  Id: 101123
}

for (let [key,value] of Object.entries(person)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}

for (let key of Object.keys(person)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}

for (let [key,value] of Object.values(person)) {
  console.log(`Value is: ${value}`);
} 


for (let res in person){
    console.log("key is: ",res);
    console.log("value is: ",person[res]);
    console.log(`${res}: ${person[res]}`)
}
```
## JavaScript Generators
In JavaScript, a regular function is executed based on the run-to-completion model. It cannot pause midway and then continues from where it paused.
A generator can pause midway and then continues from where it paused. For example:

```
function* generate() {
    console.log('invoked 1st time');
    yield 1;
    console.log('invoked 2nd time');
    yield 2;
}
```
- First, you see the asterisk (*) after the function keyword. The asterisk denotes that the generate() is a generator, not a normal function.
- Second, the yield statement returns a value and pauses the execution of the function.
